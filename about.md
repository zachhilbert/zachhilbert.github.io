I'm a cybersecurity specialist evolving traditional threat intelligence with Generative AI and RAG architectures.

With 15 years of experience in incident response, malware analysis, and cyber threat intelligence, I've spent my career hunting adversaries, analyzing TTPs, and protecting enterprise assets. From conducting deep-dive APT analysis at Cisco to leading security incident response at Atlassian, I've developed expertise in translating complex threats into actionable intelligence.

Now, I'm building the next generation of security tools by integrating LLMs and RAG systems into threat intelligence workflows. My recent work includes:

- Developing a RAG-based investigation assistant using LangChain and ChromaDB that streamlines incident response by consolidating user and system lookups into a single interface
- Actively pursuing SANS SEC495 (Secure RAG Systems) and FOR563 (Applied AI & Local LLMs) to formalize my AI security expertise
- Researching hallucination mitigation, prompt engineering, and chunking strategies optimized for security data

I see AI as a force multiplier for cybersecurity; not replacing analysts, but augmenting our ability to process threat data, surface patterns, and respond faster. My background in penetration testing, malware analysis, and threat hunting gives me a unique perspective on building AI systems that are both powerful and secure.

I'm passionate about the intersection of AI and cybersecurity, particularly in cyber threat intelligence. If you're working on similar challenges or interested in collaborating, let's connect.
