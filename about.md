First and foremost, I am a follower of Jesus Christ and dedicated to my God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.  I would have nothing without the work of God in my life.  Everything I have done and will do is with His hand, and I am grateful for what I have been blessed with.  I have many great stories of how God has saved me and my family, so if you're interested to know more, feel free to ask.

I have a beautiful family with 3 children.  Everyday, I learn something new to become a better father and husband.
